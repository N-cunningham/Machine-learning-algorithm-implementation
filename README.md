# Machine-learning-algorithm-implementation
Implementation and evaluation of a to be determined machine learning algorithm

The goal here is to select, implement and evaluate a machine learning algorithm, except for k-Nearest Neighbours, Naïve Bayes, or rather trivial ones such as ZeroR or 1R.

Algorithms you could consider:
C4.5; split into basic implementation and then purning 
CART; 
Tree Augmented Naïve Bayes; 
Logistic Regression; 
Perceptron; 
Linear SVM; 
Decision Rules; 
Adaboost;

ToDo:
----------------------------------------
Implementation
----------------------------------------
DONE - Choose programming/scripting language; JAVA
Choose algorithm
Make design decisions and document them;
Make program able to handle different numbers of attributes and training cases.;
For testing data, be able to output predicted and actual values to a file;

---------------------------------------
Testing
---------------------------------------
Randomly divide the file into 2/3 for training, 1/3 for testing;
compute the accuracy of classification;
repeat procedure with different random divisions 10 times;
report individual results and average accuracy;

---------------------------------------
Report *TBD*
